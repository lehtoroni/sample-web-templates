Responsive HTML templates for beginners (or lazy people like me)

# Editing
Feel free to adapt these to your own projects. Every template folder contains two files: index.html and style.css. The style.css file contains information about how the page should look, while the index.html file is the page itself.

So, if you wanted to, for example, change the background color or font, you would edit the style.css file. If, on the other hand, you wanted to change any text or other content that is displayed on the page itself, you would edit the index.html file. Basic HTML skills are needed, of course.
